# Elves

This is playground for various experiments, beliefs w.r.t OpenEBS. This repo 
helps OpenEBS in demonstrating &/ writing down these beliefs/thoughts.

Some of the experiments may mature into specific repositories of their own. While
many will find `elves` to be their only home.

Among other things `elves` will be help new contributors in understanding OpenEBS.
In addition, these contributors will find many of the OpenEBS design decisions, 
best practices, storage essentials, programming guidelines, etc in this repo.
