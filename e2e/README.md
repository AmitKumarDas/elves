### What is this e2e ?

This is the end-to-end automated testing project for OpenEBS.

Blogs and related documentation are in-progress.

#### Principles behind this e2e

- Keeping things simple
- Do not add things now, thinking of future
- A futuristic feature is a noise
- Each test case is scoped in its folder
- There is no customized framework involved
- Very few external libraries are used
